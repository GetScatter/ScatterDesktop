                            and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, smart contract based tokens that

                            Scatter and the supported blockchains and tokens could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of Scatter to continue to develop,

                            speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any
                            activities taking place on the supported blockchains. You acknowledge these risks and represent that Scatter cannot be held liable for such fluctuations in both time and costs.

                            <h2>13.2 Binding Arbitration</h2>

                            If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins,
                            then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating
                            to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding
                            arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer
                            related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
                            <br><br>
                            The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
                            applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim
                            is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written,
                            and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                            <br><br>
                            The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that,
                            in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

                            <br><br>
                            <h2>13.3 Location</h2>

                            Binding arbitration shall take place in New York. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York,
                            in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

                            <br><br>
                            <h2>13.4 Class Action Waiver</h2>

                            The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action,
                            and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND SCATTER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
                            ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines
                            that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration
                            provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

                            <br><br>
                            <h2>13.5 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</h2>

                            Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual
                            property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may
                            also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

                            <br><br>
                            <h2>13.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out</h2>

                            You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out
                            to the following email address: legal-opt [at] get-scatter [dot] com. The notice must be sent within 30 days of
                            your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.
                            If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Scatter also will not be bound by them.

                            <br><br>
                            <h2>13.7 Changes to this Section</h2>

                            Scatter will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims
                            arising after the 60th day.
                            <br><br>
                            For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Scatter agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located
                            in New York, New York. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.
                            <br><br>
                            The Terms and the relationship between you and Scatter shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law provisions.

                            <h2></h2>

                            These Terms (and any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation that Scatter may post on the Service) constitute the entire agreement between you and
                            Scatter with respect to the Service and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between you and Scatter. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and
                            the additional terms, rules and conditions of participation, the latter will prevail over the Terms to the extent of the conflict.

                            <br><br>
                            <h2>14.2 Waiver and Severability of Terms</h2>

                            The failure of Scatter to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms
                            is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the
                            parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.

                            <br><br>
                            <h2>14.3 Statute of Limitations</h2>

                            You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Service or the Terms must be
                            filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
